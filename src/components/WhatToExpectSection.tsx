          Your initial consultation is designed to thoroughly assess your condition,
          understand your concerns, and establish clear treatment goals. During this
          session, your physiotherapist will conduct a detailed evaluation, begin
          appropriate hands-on treatment where suitable, and develop a personalised
          rehabilitation plan tailored to your recovery.
